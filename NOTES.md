# Notes for talk

## Topics

- History of Gradle (and my history with it)
  - Gradle started in 2009-2010
  - See [their trend](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2010-01-01%202018-03-21&q=%2Fm%2F04tj5z,%2Fm%2F080c0g9,%2Fm%2F028m4s)

  - Been writing Gradle plugins since 2011 (pre 1.0)
  - Contributed a few plugins to Gradle core (lucky for me, so that I didn't have to maintain them)
    - Findbugs
    - JDepend
    - PMD
    - Jacoco
  - Been maintaining Git-related plugins since 2012
  - Clojuresque ([Meikel Brandmeyer](https://github.com/kotarak))
    - Started in 2009
    - Hasn't been maintained in a while
    - Documentation was hard to follow
  - [Graclj](https://github.com/ajoberstar/graclj)
    - Targeted at Gradle's new (at the time, now deprecated) "model space"
    - The model was meant to address a bunch of configuration ordering and visibility issues that can get gnarly with some plugins. It was going to require
    - Worked on 2015-2016, but ran into hurdles with the slow progress and poor documentation of the model. Essentially abandoned it at that time.
  - [cursive.clojure](https://github.com/cursive-ide/gradle-clojure) by [Colin Fleming](https://github.com/cmf)
    - Started in 2016, meant to address Colin's needs for building the Cursive IDE, which is a mix of Kotlin and Clojure code (from what I understand)
    - Intentionally a very minimal plugin, mostly just compilation support.
    -
  - [gradle-clojure](https://github.com/gradle-clojure)
    - A motivated individual [John Szakmeister](https://github.com/jszakmeister) reached out to Colin and I to try to get some momentum on a Gradle plugin.
    - He organized a call with one of Gradle's devs, which helped us figure out some parameters of the project.
    - Since then I've
- Gradle wrapper
  - Wrapper vs normal install
- Gradle's 3 phases (initialization, configuration, execution)
  - init scripts
  - settings.gradle
  - build.gradle
- Gradle plugins
  - Core plugins
  - Plugin portal
- Multi project builds
  - Hava a Java library
  - Have a Kotlin library
  - Clojure backend
  - Clojurescript frontend
- Polyglot builds
  - Java depending on Clojure
  - Kotlin depending on Clojure
  - Clojure depending on Java
  - Clojure depending on Kotlin
- REPL usage
  - Local usage (is that even possible?)
  - Atom usage
  - Cursive usage (?)
- Executing clojure.test tests
  - Test report
  - Test selection
  - Test logging (use as example of init script)
  - Continuous mode
